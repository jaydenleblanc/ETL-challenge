## Music Festival Artist Reviews

The general process of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) occurs when data copied from one or more sources and is then uploaded to a final destination source(s), but is manipulated and appears differently than the source data and/or in a different context than the source.

## Objective

Using a database from the musical festival, Pitchfork, and song data from Spotify, a SQL database was created and queried. The final objective was to create a table of the relationship between the two data sources and show the music festival reviews for each related Spotify artist.
